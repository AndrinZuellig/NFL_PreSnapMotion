This project examines the role of pre-snap motion in influencing defensive coverage schemes (man vs. zone) and its effect on offensive outcomes in the NFL. 
Using metrics like Expected Points (EP) and Expected Points Added (EPA), we analyze how motion interacts with defensive strategies to shape play results.

The repository includes:
	•	PDF Report: Detailed analysis with plots and interpretations.
	•	RMarkdown (RMD) File: Reproducible code and steps used for the analysis.
